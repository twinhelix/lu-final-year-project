*Tit For Tat - Repeat opponent's last choice.
*Tit For Tat and Random - Repeat opponent's last choice skewed by random setting.*
*Tit For Two Tats and Random - Like Tit For Tat except that opponent must make the same choice twice in a row before it is reciprocated. Choice is skewed by random setting.*
*Tit For Two Tats - Like Tit For Tat except that opponent must make the same choice twice in row before it is reciprocated.
*Suspicious Tit For Tat - As for Tit For Tat except begins by defecting.
*Naive Prober (Tit For Tat with Random Defection) - Repeat opponent's last choice (ie Tit For Tat), but sometimes probe by defecting in lieu of co-operating.*
*Remorseful Prober (Tit For Tat with Random Defection) - Repeat opponent's last choice (ie Tit For Tat), but sometimes probe by defecting in lieu of co-operating. If the opponent defects in response to probing, show remorse by co-operating once.*
*Naive Peace Maker (Tit For Tat with Random Co-operation) - Repeat opponent's last choice (ie Tit For Tat), but sometimes make peace by co-operating in lieu of defecting.*
*True Peace Maker (hybrid of Tit For Tat and Tit For Two Tats with Random Co-operation) - Co-operate unless opponent defects twice in a row, then defect once, but sometimes make peace by co-operating in lieu of defecting.*
*Random - always set at 50% probability.
*Always Defect
*Always Co-operate
*Alternate strategy - always play alternating defect/co-operate.
*Grudger (Co-operate, but only be a sucker once) - Co-operate until the opponent defects. Then always defect unforgivingly.
*Soft Grudger - Co-operates until the opponent defects, in such case opponent is punished with d,d,d,d,c,c.
*Pavlov (repeat last choice if good outcome) - If 5 or 3 points scored in the last round then repeat last choice.
*Pavlov / Random (repeat last choice if good outcome and Random) - If 5 or 3 points scored in the last round then repeat last choice, but sometimes make random choices.*
*Adaptive - Starts with c,c,c,c,c,c,d,d,d,d,d and then takes choices which have given the best average score re-calculated after every move.
*Gradual - Co-operates until the opponent defects, in such case defects the total number of times the opponent has defected during the game. Followed up by two co-operations.
